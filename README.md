# Dockerized CRUD Application with CI/CD

This repository contains a Dockerized CRUD application with an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The stack includes a Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and NGINX as a reverse proxy.

## Features

- **CRUD Functionality**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Containerized services for easy deployment.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Persistent data storage.
- **NGINX**: Acts as a reverse proxy.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deploy using GitHub Actions.
- **Docker Hub Integration**: Pushes Docker images for deployment.

## Architecture

1. **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL
3. **Proxy**: NGINX
4. **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose
5. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

---

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Node.js (if running locally)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```bash
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=postgres
   DB_NAME=crudapp
   DB_HOST=db
   DB_PORT=5432
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the app:

   - **Backend**: `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured in your `Dockerfile`)
   - **NGINX**: `http://localhost`

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Workflow Summary

1. **Build**:
   - The pipeline builds Docker images for all services.
   - Pushes the images to Docker Hub.

2. **Deploy**:
   - Pulls images from Docker Hub on a self-hosted runner.
   - Rebuilds and restarts services with `docker-compose`.

### Trigger

- **Push to `main`**: Automatically triggers the pipeline.
- **Pull Requests**: Runs tests and builds the application.

### Environment Variables

Store sensitive values in GitHub Secrets:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

## Deployment

1. Ensure the `self-hosted` runner is set up on your server.
2. Add the following files to your server:
   - `.env`
   - `docker-compose.yml`

3. Run the following commands for manual deployment:

   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Proxy**: NGINX
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: Git

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add unit and integration tests.
- Implement a frontend for the CRUD app.
- Set up monitoring and logging for containers.
